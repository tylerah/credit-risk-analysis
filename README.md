# Analysis of Credit Risk Using Supervised Machine Learning
## Overview
Personal loans are one of the most lucrative services provided by banks and various lenders. However, it is important that a thorough analysis of each potential borrower is performed before issuing a loan in order to ensure that the money will be repaid. In this project, various supervised machine learning algorithms were performed in order to automate this evluation process. The accuracy and precision of each process was evaluated in order to make a recommendation as to which would perform the best. 

The following types of algorithms were evaluated:
1. Naive Random Oversampling
2. SMOTE Oversampling
3. Cluster Centroid Undersampling
4. SMOTEENN Sampling
5. Balanced Random Forest Classifying
6. Easy Ensemble Classifying

Note that the first four methods were run in a jupyter notebook while the last two (Balanced Random Forest and Easy Ensemble) were run in a Google Colaboratory notebook. The results of each are provided in the following section. 

## Results
